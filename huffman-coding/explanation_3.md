## Overview

A couple of years ago went through a data compression subject, 
solved the same problem in C, it's a similar implementation in Python.
I chose a priority queue and a binary tree which are suggested in the problem
description.  

Time complexity: **O(nlog(n))**, build tree method is the most complex.  
Space complexity: **O(n)**, algorithm needs to keep n nodes.
