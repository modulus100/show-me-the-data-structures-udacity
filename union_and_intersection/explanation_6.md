## Overview

LinkedList was given as a base data structure which works fine for
solving such problems, simple list also could be used. In order to 
solve **union** and **intersection** I found sets useful in order
to keep track on which values have been already added and which not. It helps
me to avoid copies.  

Time complexity: **O(n + m)**  
Where **n** is a fist list size and **m** is a second list size.
